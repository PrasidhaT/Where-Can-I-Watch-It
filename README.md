## Synopsis

Where Can I Watch is a simple app that allows users to search for a movie
or a TV and links to where it's available. Ever wondered if your favorite show was on Netflix? Maybe It's on Hulu, or wait, did you check Amazon Prime? Sometimes you can't even stream it and you just want to rent or buy it. Our app includes all the links to all the locations that the movie or show is avilable!
